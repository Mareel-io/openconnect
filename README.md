# OpenConnect

OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client initially created to support [Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN](http://www.cisco.com/go/asm).

It has since been ported to support the Juniper SSL VPN (which is now known as [Pulse Connect Secure](https://www.pulsesecure.net/products/connect-secure/)),
the [Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect SSL VPN](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/features/vpn)
the [F5 Big-IP SSL VPN](https://www.f5.com/products/big-ip-services),
and the [Fortinet Fortigate SSL VPN](https://www.fortinet.com/products/vpn).</p>

An openconnect VPN server (ocserv), which implements an improved version of the Cisco AnyConnect protocol, has also been written.
You can find it on Gitlab at [https://gitlab.com/openconnect/ocserv](https://gitlab.com/openconnect/ocserv).

If you're looking for the standard `vpnc-script`, which is invoked by OpenConnect for routing and DNS setup,
you can find it on Gitlab at [https://gitlab.com/openconnect/vpnc-script](https://gitlab.com/openconnect/vpnc-script).
